This README has the following sections:

Requirements
************

There are two requirements:

1) A working installation of OCaML.  If you don't have this, you can get it
   from GODI at "http://godi.ocaml-programming.de/". You can find out more
   about OCaML (and also get it) from the OCaML homepage
   "http://caml.inria.fr/".

2) The xtype library.  This package of modules is available where you got this-- at 
   "http://phonology.cogsci.udel.edu/~heinz/software/".

************
Introduction
************
								   
FSM consists of several OCaML modules in an OCaML libray, and a
command line executable that implement finite state acceptors.  The
implementation includes a number of functions including determinizing,
minimizing (i.e. finding a canonical acceptor), multiplying, adding,
generating words, merging of states to get new acceptors, etc.


*************************
Installation Instructions
*************************

1) Make sure that the xtype folder and the fsm folder are sister folders
   (i.e. in the same directory).

2) Make the current working directory /your/path/to/fsm.

3) At the command line enter the following.

       > make

   If the modules in xtype have not been made yet, this should do it (as well
   as the modules in fsm). 

4) To make command line executable run quickly on your machine, type:

       > make opt

   If `make opt' has not been run from the xtype directory you will need to do
   switch to that directory, type `make opt' in that directory and then return
   to this directory and type `make opt'.

5) To produce the documentation, enter the following two commands. I recommend
   doing this to see how things work!

       > mkdir doc  

       > make doc

   There will be a number of warning errors that appear when you make the
   documentation. This is because I haven't figured out yet how to make it link
   to the documentation in the Tools directory.

6) That's it!


*******
Usage
*******

If you plan to use these program a lot, I recommend adding the following to your
.ocamlinit file, which should always be in your home directory.

   #directory "/your/path/to/xtype";;
   #directory "/your/path/to/fsm";;

   #load "xtype.cma";;
   #load "fsm.cma";;


The command line is run the way other OCaML executables are run. From the fsm
directory, enter the following.

   > ./fsa

If you plan to use the executable a lot, I recommend setting up an alias.  The
way you do this depends on what kind of shell you use. For the bash shell, you
can add the following to your .bashrc file (in your home directory).

alias fsa=/your/path/to/fsm/./fsa

Then you can run it from anywhere.

Examples
*********

There are some examples of usage of the OCaML modules and the command line
executable in the directory called "examples".
