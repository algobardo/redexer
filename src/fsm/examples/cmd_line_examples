Examples for fsa
*******************


Here are some examples of how the command line executable can be used.

You can apply operations on files. 

> ./fsa reverse pintupi.fsa

As you can see, the result is printed to standard output. Thus you can
redirect it to a file, if you like.

> ./fsa reverse pintupi.fsa > pintupi_r.fsa

If you leave the file name out, it will wait for you to enter a fsa.

> ./fsa reverse

Then enter the following:

0!
0,1,a
!a


Now we minimize the reverse acceptor. 

> ./fsa minimize pintupi_r.fsa

But we can do all of this in one step by piping:

> ./fsa reverse pintupi.fsa | ./fsa minimize 

We provide a quicker way by allowing the use of flags:

> ./fsa reverse -m pintupi.fsa 

Often we want to rename an acceptor we have minimized:

> ./fsa reverse -m -rn pintupi.fsa

When we stack flags they apply left to right.

Of course we can always just rename directly, e.g:

> ./fsa rename pintupi.fsa


If you want to see an acceptor, pipe the output to the dot command.

> ./fsa minimize -rn pintupi.fsa | dot -Tgif > pintupi.gif

Then just open the gif with your favorite viewer.


This should be enough to get you started. See the documentation for more
information.
