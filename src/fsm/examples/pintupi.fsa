% Lines that begin wth '%' are comments.
%
% Here is an example machine representing the stress pattern of a language
% which allows stressed monosyllables (based on Pintupi).

% The start states are listed first. If there is more than one start state
% they are separated by commas. Here we only have one.

A!

% The exclamation point delimits the start states from the transitions. It
% doesn't have to be on the same line, though it is here.

A,B,2
B,C,0
C,E,1
E,C,0
C,D,0

% Transitions have three parts separated by commas: origin,terminus, label.

% The exclamation point delimits the transitions from the final accepting
% states which are delimited by commas.

!B,C,D

% If you prefer to use different delimiters than commas and exclamation points
% you can do so. For command line usage, just write the delimiters you want to
% use in the "fsa_specs" file. For OCaML programming, just build the FSA module
% with different delimiter modules.
